imerosnthanatos is a world resident with an insatiable desire to hunt for the boundaries of consciousness. His background began with an introduction to the sciences from literary beatniks including Keroauc, Ginsberg, as well as Debian and MS. Through his in depth understanding of self imposed suffering and selfish disregard for the doors of perception he has found himself painfully waking in a familiar interbeing networked with others while his his perennial and contextualistic ideology has called him to public interest.  His professional career involves nothing of note, publicly.  Interests include mysticism, human behavior, computers, magic, tantra, yoga, and philosophy. Self-defense as well.
